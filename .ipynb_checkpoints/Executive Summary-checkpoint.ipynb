While most of the data is concentrated on the low end of this spectrum (The average purchase is just over $120.00.), several sales ranked in the thousands. The unique Iowa liquor sales seem to require that both private individuals and restaurants and bars buy their liquor from the same place. This facet of Iowan law will factor into our final recommendations."

This grouping will be useful if future analyses requires that stores be broken down by the demographics they serve. "

    "We recommend further analysis to better understand where this revenue will be coming from and who among your tax base it will most affect. This first round of modelling only used stores as a the category by which sales were broken down. This provided a really solid foundation for getting at an overall model, but more specific information could be really useful. For example, the data clearly delineates the types of liquor sold at each sale. It could be useful to examine sales by category. A small increase in high-end liquor sales might mean more taxable revenue than a larger increase in low-end liquor sales. In a similar vein, it can be useful to investigate which sales are associated with individual purchasers, and which ones are with secondary retailers like bars or restaurants. Perhaps different tax rates should be considered for these various parties. "
