While most of the data is concentrated on the low end of this spectrum (The average purchase is just over $120.00.), several sales ranked in the thousands. The unique Iowa liquor sales seem to require that both private individuals and restaurants and bars buy their liquor from the same place. This facet of Iowan law will factor into our final recommendations."

This grouping will be useful if future analyses requires that stores be broken down by the demographics they serve. "
